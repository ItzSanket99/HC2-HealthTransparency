# 🏥 TreatWise – Healthcare Transparency & Decision Intelligence Platform

TreatWise is a healthcare transparency platform designed to help patients make informed decisions based on structured, real-world treatment data. Unlike traditional review systems that rely on generic star ratings, TreatWise converts patient feedback into measurable healthcare intelligence such as billing deviation, insurance efficiency, recovery outcomes, and wait times.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Patients in India often make critical healthcare decisions without transparent and structured information. While hospital ratings and reviews exist, they rarely provide insights into:

- Final treatment cost vs estimated cost
- Hidden charges
- Insurance claim approval delays
- Recovery duration
- Treatment outcome success rates

This lack of transparency increases financial risk, medical uncertainty, and decision anxiety for patients and their families.

TreatWise solves this by transforming patient reviews into structured, actionable healthcare intelligence.

# 📊 Platform Workflow

1. Patient searches treatment  
2. Hospitals displayed in list + map view  
3. Patient selects hospital  
4. Cost estimator calculates final payable amount  
5. Eligibility checker applies scheme benefits  
6. Appointment booking  
7. Notification sent  
8. Review submission

# 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- Combines cost transparency + location intelligence  
- Implements financial logic in healthcare decisions  
- Uses RBAC security model  
- Integrates eligibility-based dynamic pricing  
- Provides real-world patient utility  

This is not just a listing platform.  
It is a **Healthcare Financial Decision Intelligence System**.

# 📈 Future Scope

- Real-time insurance API integration  
- AI-based hospital recommendation engine  
- Predictive cost modeling using ML  
- Blockchain-based verified reviews  
- EHR integration  
- Mobile application
